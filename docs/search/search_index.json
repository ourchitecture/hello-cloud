Development This project attempts to support a variety of developer tooling choices while maintaining a standard that everyone can test against. Prerequisites \u26a0\ufe0f Windows users: \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc task automation assumes a POSIX-compatible shell with Linux commands that work across most distributions and macOS. As a result, using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) \ud83d\udd17 is recommended with a Linux distribution like Debian, Ubuntu, or Kali Linux. You may also use Git BASH \ud83d\udd17 with make for Git BASH \ud83d\udd17 installed or cygwin \ud83d\udd17 with make for cygwin \ud83d\udd17 installed. You could also use a Linux virtual machine running on Windows Hyper-V \ud83d\udd17, Oracle VirtualBox \ud83d\udd17, or even using a VS Code \"devcontainer\" \ud83d\udd17. Tools: git \ud83d\udd17 for source control. git-town \ud83d\udd17 may be used for improved developer workflow. yarn \ud83d\udd17 or node \ud83d\udd17 are required to run the project * yarn is recommended . The version of yarn is \"pinned\" in \".yarnrc\" and will be automatically selected and used by the yarn command. nvm \ud83d\udd17 can make switching between specific versions of node , npm , and npx easier across projects for a more consistent project experience across machines. The version of node is \"pinned\" in \".nvmrc\" and will be automatically selected and used by the nvm use command. podman \ud83d\udd17, docker \ud83d\udd17, or docker with docker-compose \ud83d\udd17 are required to build the documentation and production container images. GNU make \ud83d\udd17 is used by DevOps pipelines Continuous Integration (CI) and Deployment (CD) to execute tasks. For consistency, you may choose to use this as well. VS code \ud83d\udd17 may be used for an improved developer experience with support for project-specific settings, extensions, and tasks. Executing tasks Task execution consistency can be critical when developing and triaging code. While many tools are supported, \"there is only one way\" for production, including the DevOps pipeline automation tasks. Local development machines and even DevOps pipeline machines have different Operating Systems, middleware tools, and configurations; they cannot be trusted to be reliable. Therefore, the \"one way\" is through containers and the default tool of choice is docker \ud83d\udc33; while this project would prefer to use a completely free and open source ecosystem like podman \ud83e\udd70\ud83d\udc96, docker is well established, virtually ubiquitous on most local and DevOps machines, and mostly free \ud83d\udd17 \ud83d\udcb8. All automation tasks are abstracted behind make \u2699\ufe0f command targets. This enables task consistency across projects and tooling. You may run most commands using your choice of podman , docker , docker-compose , yarn , or node / npm by adding a \"dev_tool\" parameter to the make command, where the value of the parameter matches your preferred tool (e.g. make install dev_tool=yarn or make start dev_tool=podman ). However, docker is recommended as the default tool used by DevOps pipeline tasks for production build, test, and deploy. If you do not wish to use make (e.g. yarn && yarn start ), review the commands in the \"./makefile\" and construct the appropriate command or simply try out what you expect to work. Running tasks Clone the repository with the command git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ericis/hello-cloud Navigate to the project in a terminal or open your favorite editor Build the project with the command make or make install ( make build will also work if your forget) Start the system with the command make start ( make run , make up and make serve will also work if your forget) Stop the system with the default command make stop ( make down will also work if your forget). If you use an alternative tool running as a foreground process (e.g. yarn start ), simply kill the process (e.g. Command + . on macOS or Ctrl + C on Windows). Clean up temporary task artifacts with the command make clean ( make uninstall will also work if your forget)","title":"Contribute"},{"location":"contribute/#contributing","text":"\ud83d\udc4b\ud83c\udffc Welcome and we are glad you are interested in contributing!","title":"Contributing"},{"location":"contribute/#development","text":"This project attempts to support a variety of developer tooling choices while maintaining a standard that everyone can test against.","title":"Development"},{"location":"contribute/#prerequisites","text":"\u26a0\ufe0f Windows users: \ud83d\udc49\ud83c\udffc task automation assumes a POSIX-compatible shell with Linux commands that work across most distributions and macOS.

Deployments Docker The \"hello-world/our-hello-nodejs-expressjs-webapi\" docker image is simply the packaged and runnable version of the web service. Using the standard developer make tasks, the service can be containerized and executed with docker , docker-compose or podman . The DevOps pipeline for Continuous Integration (CI) and Deployment (CD) uses the make deploy task to build and deploy the service as a container ( make deploy only supports \"dev_tool=docker\" or \"dev_tool=podman\" ). The GitHub Actions workflow \"./.github/workflows/nodejs_expressjs_webapi.yml\" authenticates to the GitHub Container Registry for this repository and pushes (publishes) the \"hello-world/our-hello-nodejs-expressjs-webapi\" image . Multi-cloud While each cloud provider below has unique prerequisites and important notes, all of the tasks to deploy to each provider has been abstracted with the following automation tasks. Simply specify the provider as the argument (e.g. make cloud-init cloud=aws ) Initialize with the command make cloud-init cloud=aws|azure|gcloud|heroku] Install (deploy) with the command make cloud-install cloud=aws|azure|gcloud|heroku Get the applicaiton logs with the command make cloud-logs cloud=aws|azure|gcloud|heroku Uninstall (delete/destroy) with the command make cloud-uninstall cloud=aws|azure|gcloud|heroku Amazon Web Services (AWS) Prerequisites An AWS account *this project worked with free infrastructure at the time of its creation eb CLI Steps to deploy Open a terminal and navigate to the service project directory (e.g. cd ./src/nodejs/expressjs/webapi ) Run the command make aws-init to create the AWS Elastic Beanstalk Environment. This command may take a few minutes. The eb CLI will prompt you for access credentials. Create a new access key by visiting \"Your Security Credentials\" , expanding \"Access keys\" and creating a new key. Install the application with the command make aws-install . This command may take several seconds. Check the application logs with the command make aws-logs Uninstall and clean up the application deployment with the command make aws-uninstall . This command may take several seconds. Microsoft Azure Prerequisites An Azure account *this project worked with free infrastructure at the time of its creation az CLI Steps to deploy Open a terminal and navigate to the service project directory (e.g. cd ./src/nodejs/expressjs/webapi ) Login to your Azure account with the CLI using the command az login If you have more than one subscription, first set the default subscription Run the command make azure-init to create the Azure Resource Group Install the application with the command make azure-install Check the application logs with the command make azure-logs Uninstall and clean up the application deployment with the command make azure-uninstall Google Cloud Prerequisites An Google Cloud account *this project worked with free infrastructure at the time of its creation Google Cloud SDK Google Cloud Billing Account Enable Google Cloud Build with the command gcloud services enable cloudbuild.googleapis.com Steps to deploy Open a terminal and navigate to the service project directory (e.g. cd ./src/nodejs/expressjs/webapi ) Login to your Google Cloud account with the CLI using the command gcloud auth login Run the command make gcloud-init gcloud_project_name_suffix=001 to create the Google Cloud project Install the application with the command make gcloud-install Check the application logs with the command make gcloud-logs Uninstall and clean up the application deployment with the command make gcloud-uninstall gcloud_project_name_suffix=001 *Update the \"gcloud_project_name_suffix\" argument value for gcloud-init and gcloud-uninstall by incrementing the number to ensure a unique project name, or specify a custom unique name by using the argument \"gcloud_project_unique_name\" instead.
