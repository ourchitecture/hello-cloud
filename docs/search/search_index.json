Defined While each cloud provider provides their own definition for cloud computing (e.g. AWS, Azure, Google, RedHat, etc.), one historical standard was set forth by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), U.S. Department of Commerce , titled \"The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing\" . The NIST Definition of Cloud Computing... Essential Characteristics On-demand self-service. A consumer can unilaterally provision computing capabilities, such as server time and network storage, as needed automatically without requiring human interaction with each service provider. Broad network access. Capabilities are available over the network and accessed through standard mechanisms that promote use by heterogeneous thin or thick client platforms (e.g., mobile phones, tablets, laptops, and workstations). Resource pooling. The provider's computing resources are pooled to serve multiple consumers using a multi-tenant model, with different physical and virtual resources dynamically assigned and reassigned according to consumer demand. There is a sense of location independence in that the customer generally has no control or knowledge over the exact location of the provided resources but may be able to specify location at a higher level of abstraction (e.g., country, state, or datacenter). Examples of resources include storage, processing, memory, and network bandwidth. Rapid elasticity. Capabilities can be elastically provisioned and released, in some cases automatically, to scale rapidly outward and inward commensurate with demand. To the consumer, the capabilities available for provisioning often appear to be unlimited and can be appropriated in any quantity at any time. Measured service. Cloud systems automatically control and optimize resource use by leveraging a metering capability at some level of abstraction appropriate to the type of service (e.g., storage, processing, bandwidth, and active user accounts). Resource usage can be monitored, controlled, and reported, providing transparency for both the provider and consumer of the utilized service. Service Models Software as a Service (SaaS). The capability provided to the consumer is to use the provider's applications running on a cloud infrastructure. The applications are accessible from various client devices through either a thin client interface, such as a web browser (e.g., web-based email), or a program interface. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, storage, or even individual application capabilities, with the possible exception of limited user - specific application configuration settings. Platform as a Service (PaaS). The capability provided to the consumer is to deploy onto the cloud infrastructure consumer -created or acquired applications created using programming languages, libraries, services, and tools supported by the provider. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure including network, servers, operating systems, or storage, but has control over the deployed applications and possibly configuration settings for the application-hosting environment. Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS). The capability provided to the consumer is to provision processing, storage, networks, and other fundamental computing resources where the consumer is able to deploy and run arbitrary software, which can include operating systems and applications. The consumer does not manage or control the underlying cloud infrastructure but has control over operating systems, storage, and deployed applications; and possibly limited control of select networking components (e.g., host firewalls). Deployment Models Private cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers (e.g., business units) . It may be owned, managed, and operated by the organization, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises. Community cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a specific community of consumers from organizations that have shared concerns (e.g., mission, security requirements, policy, and compliance considerations). It may be owned, managed, and operated by one or more of the organizations in the community, a third party, or some combination of them, and it may exist on or off premises. Public cloud. The cloud infrastructure is provisioned for open use by the general public. It may be owned, managed, and operated by a business, academic, or government organization, or some combination of them. It exists on the premises of the cloud provider. Hybrid cloud. The cloud infrastructure is a composition of two or more distinct cloud infrastructures (private, community, or public) that remain unique entities, but are bound together by standardized or proprietary technology that enables data and application portability (e.g., cloud bursting for load balancing between clouds). Cloud Deployment Types Building on the NIST definitions, BMC has provided a list of things to consider when comparing the cloud deployment types below. Key benefits & drawbacks of cloud computing types Choosing a cloud abstraction is an architecture decision with significant impacts to end-to-end system design, development, testing, integration and deployment, and operations and support. Traditional models compare the ownership concerns when targeting on-site, Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and/or Software as a Service (SaaS). However, cloud has continued to evolve and blur the boundaries between these deployment models.

Currently, the entire monorepo must be synchronized with the Heroku repo. As a result, the heroku CLI was containerized with just the application code, initializing an empty git repository within (local to) the container and the code files were added and committed. This was sufficient to synchronize the application with Heroku. Heroku tooling complains when a \"shallow clone\" is made (e.g. git clone --depth=1 ... ); history is required. Just like the monorepo problem, containerizing the heroku CLI and application code fix this as well. .NET Core is not an officially supported language, requiring the use of an unsupported community user buildpack .

What great ideas to you have to demonstrate getting systems to the cloud? A working program 1. The 'Hello World' program Check if the idea is already on the roadmap or has already been submitted as an issue . Submit an issue that describes your idea to start a discussion. Fork this project and clone it to your local system. Review the \"Development\" steps below. Review one of the existing projects for similarities to your idea. Create a new directory for your source code (e.g. \"./src/services/[language/framework]\" for web services or \"./src/apps/[language/framework]\" for web applications). Add a basic \"hello world\" example using the language and framework of choice. Commit small, working changes regularly and please use \"conventional commit messages\" . You can see existing examples of commit messages . Automate the developer tasks by creating a new \"./makefile\" in your project, copy command targets from an existing \"./makefile\" from another project and customize the commands to work with your language and framework. Ignore any deployment commands for now and also ignore command targets you are not ready or not sure how to implement. Commit your changes. Add the path to your project in the root \"./makefile\" in the space-separated \"project_dirs\" variable list. This will enable developers to build and run all projects at the same time, including yours. Commit your changes. Submit a \"draft pull request\" back to this project.

Containers Once you have a basic \"hello world\" example working, it's time to containerize your build and test workflow as well as the system deployment, so that it can be executed by any Open Container Initiative-compatible runtime across machines including locally by developers and DevOps pipeline automation. Review an existing \"./makefile\" from another project and customize your project's commands to work with docker , docker-compose and podman . Hopefully, a base docker image will already exist to mount and execute your application (e.g. node ). If so, use this as your base. If not, consider choosing Alpine Linux , Debian , or Ubuntu for your base image. Create a \"Dockerfile\" and test your container locally. Commit your changes.

Finalize PR Although your project has not even been deployed to a major cloud provider yet, the basic foundation now exists to integrate cloud automation tasks. If your PR is finalized and has been approved, we will merge your PR to the \"main\" branch, your project container will be built and published, and your project will be added to the public documentation.

Pick just one cloud Pick one of the major cloud providers that you will target a deployment for (e.g. AWS, Azure, GCP, or Heroku). If your cloud provider is not in this list, please first propose a new one by submitting an issue and we can discuss the proposal. Please understand that your request could be denied. You will need an account that may incur costs when testing your cloud deployment. Most \"hello world\" implementations are free or very cheap on major cloud providers, especially if you focus on automating destruction of cloud resources and destroy them immediately after creating them and testing for success. Review an existing project's cloud deployment documentation. Review an existing project's \"./makefile\" cloud deployment command targets. Begin work to add your own cloud deployment command targets to your project's \"./makefile\". Commit your changes. Begin to document the steps by copying and pasting the cloud section from an existing project and customizing as required. Commit your changes. Update your project's \"Roadmap\" section with what has been completed and possible next steps. Commit your changes. Submit another \"draft pull request\" back to this project to start the discussion on your cloud deployment tasks. Please be open to making any suggested changes. 2. Finalize PR We will work to test the cloud deployment. If your PR is finalized and has been approved, we will merge your PR to the \"main\" branch and your project's cloud deployment documentation will be updated in the public documentation. 3. Enhance, enhance, enhance As you did in the first step, you and even others may continue to enhance this great project! Development This project attempts to support a variety of developer tooling choices while maintaining a standard that everyone can test against. Development resources Submit an issue Comment on an issue Star Watch Fork Prerequisites Windows users Task automation assumes a POSIX-compatible shell with Linux commands that work across most distributions and macOS. As a result, using Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL2) is recommended with a Linux distribution like Debian, Ubuntu, or Kali Linux. You may also use Git BASH with make for Git BASH installed or cygwin with make for cygwin installed. You could also use a Linux virtual machine running on Windows Hyper-V , Oracle VirtualBox , or even using a VS Code \"devcontainer\" . Tools Avoid Global installations of gradle or maven are not needed or recommended. The Java and Kotlin projects use Gradle wrapper and Maven wrapper with a pinned, project-specific version to ensure version consistency across machines. Required git for source control. docker , docker-compose , or podman are required to build the documentation and production container images. Recommended GNU make is required for DevOps pipelines Continuous Integration (CI) and Deployment (CD) tasks. For consistency, this install is recommended. ( Windows users: see note above ) Optional... yarn or node are required to run NodeJS projects ( yarn is recommended ). The version of yarn is \"pinned\" in \".yarnrc\" and will be automatically selected and used by the yarn command. However, container runtimes make this installation optional. nvm can make switching between specific versions of node , npm , and npx easier across projects for a more consistent project experience across machines. The version of node is \"pinned\" in \".nvmrc\" and will be automatically selected and used by the nvm use command. However, container runtimes make this installation optional. java 11 OpenJDK is required to run Java and Kotlin projects. However, container runtimes make this installation optional. dotnet 6 SDK is required to run .NET projects. However, container runtimes make this installation optional. VS code may be used for an improved developer experience with support for project-specific settings, extensions, and tasks. git-town may be used for improved developer workflow. Executing tasks Task execution consistency can be critical when developing and triaging code. While many tools are supported, \"there is only one way\" for production, including the DevOps pipeline automation tasks. Local development machines and even DevOps pipeline machines have different Operating Systems, middleware tools, and configurations; they cannot be trusted to be reliable. Therefore, the \"one way\" is through containers and the default tool of choice is docker ; while this project would prefer to use a completely free and open source ecosystem like podman , docker is a well established project, virtually ubiquitous on most local and DevOps machines, and mostly free . Commands that work across all projects All automation tasks are abstracted behind make command targets. This enables task consistency across projects and tooling. You may run most commands using your choice of podman , docker , docker-compose , gradle or maven (for Java and Kotlin projects), yarn or node / npm (for Node projects), or dotnet (for .NET projects) by adding a \"dev_tool\" parameter to the make command, where the value of the parameter matches your preferred tool (e.g. make install dev_tool=yarn ; make start dev_tool=podman ; make run dev_tool=dotnet ). However, docker is recommended as the default \"dev_tool\", since it is also used by DevOps pipeline tasks for production build, test, and deploy. Clone the repository with the command git clone --depth=1 https://github.com/ourchitecture/hello-cloud ( SalesForce Heroku rejects pushes from shallow clones , so remove the --depth=1 argument) Navigate to the project in a terminal or open your favorite editor Build the project with the command make or make install ( make build will also work) Test the system with the command make check ( make test will also work) Start the system with the command make start ( make run , make up and make serve will also work) Stop the system with the default command make stop ( make down will also work). If you use an alternative tool running as a foreground process (e.g. yarn start ), simply kill the process (e.g. Cmd + . on macOS or Ctrl + C on Windows). Clean up temporary task artifacts with the command make clean ( make uninstall will also work) Using locally installed tools... If you do not wish to use make , review the commands in the \"./makefile\" and construct the appropriate command or simply try out what you expect to work. # instead of using make across all projects # and not needing to know specific tools or their arguments # and even forgetting exactly which command to use # among other synonym alternatives... # example: $ make start # or make [start,run,up,serve] # and, instead of running make with a variety of tooling choices... # examples: $ make start dev_tool = podman $ make start dev_tool = docker $ make start dev_tool = docker-compose $ make start dev_tool = node $ make start dev_tool = npm $ make start dev_tool = yarn $ make start dev_tool = gradle $ make start dev_tool = gradlew $ make start dev_tool = maven $ make start dev_tool = mvn $ make start dev_tool = mvnw $ make start dev_tool = dotnet # ... you can use the tools themselves directly # this is especially useful for getting things working # however, once things are working, # it's great to go back and re-test the make commands # to ensure consistent command definitions and execution # across machines (developers and DevOps pipelines) # run a NodeJS project with native commands # (may have project-specific arguments) $ npm install && npm start $ yarn && yarn start # run a Java or Kotlin project with native commands # (may have project-specific arguments) $ ./gradlew bootRun $ ./mvnw spring-boot:run # run a .NET Core project with native commands # (may have project-specific arguments) $ dotnet run","title":"Contribute"},{"location":"contribute/#contributing","text":"Welcome and we are glad you are interested in contributing!

Run the command make aws-init to verify your tool installations. Install the application with the command make aws-install . This command may take several seconds. Check the application logs with the command make aws-logs . Help wanted to automate this command. Uninstall and clean up the application deployment with the command make aws-uninstall .

However, some timing issues have been observed as well as having to manually enable \"Code Build\" and manually associating dynamically created projects with a billing account. Contributions are welcome! Commands Open a terminal and navigate to the service project directory (e.g. cd ./src/services/dotnet/webapi ). Login to your Google Cloud account with the CLI using the command gcloud auth login . Run the command make gcloud-init gcloud_project_name_suffix=001 to create the Google Cloud project. If the output indicates that billing must be enabled, login to the projects list and associate the newly created project with the appropriate billing account (even if you are using free resources). Once the project is associated with a billing account, re-run the \"gcloud-init\" command above. Install the application with the command make gcloud-install . Check the application logs with the command make gcloud-logs . Uninstall and clean up the application deployment with the command make gcloud-uninstall gcloud_project_name_suffix=001 . Tip: Project Naming Update the \"gcloud_project_name_suffix\" argument value for gcloud-init and gcloud-uninstall by incrementing the number to ensure a unique project name, or specify a custom unique name by using the argument \"gcloud_project_unique_name\" instead. By default, Google Cloud retains deleted projects for several days, so it is not possible to recreate the same project multiple times within a short period. A future contribution to this project could simply restore a deleted project if it was recently deleted and use the same name.

However, some timing issues have been observed as well as having to manually enable \"Code Build\" and manually associating dynamically created projects with a billing account. Contributions are welcome! Plugins Google Cloud has documentation for both Gradle and Maven plugins. However, this project focuses on using the gcloud CLI to deploy, allowing the independent choice of either Gradle or Maven. Note that Microsoft Azure support for Kotlin SpringBoot deployments seems to require using their Maven plug-in and does not support Gradle. Commands Open a terminal and navigate to the service project directory (e.g. cd ./src/services/jvm/kotlin/springboot/webapi ). Login to your Google Cloud account with the CLI using the command gcloud auth login . Run the command make gcloud-init gcloud_project_name_suffix=001 to create the Google Cloud project. If the output indicates that billing must be enabled, login to the projects list and associate the newly created project with the appropriate billing account (even if you are using free resources). Once the project is associated with a billing account, re-run the \"gcloud-init\" command above. Install the application with the command make gcloud-install . Check the application logs with the command make gcloud-logs . Uninstall and clean up the application deployment with the command make gcloud-uninstall gcloud_project_name_suffix=001 . Tip: Project Naming Update the \"gcloud_project_name_suffix\" argument value for gcloud-init and gcloud-uninstall by incrementing the number to ensure a unique project name, or specify a custom unique name by using the argument \"gcloud_project_unique_name\" instead. By default, Google Cloud retains deleted projects for several days, so it is not possible to recreate the same project multiple times within a short period.
